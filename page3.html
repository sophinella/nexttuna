Data protection is particularly important to us. It is possible to use the Nexttuna website without providing any personal data. However, if a person concerned wishes to make use of special services provided by our company via our website, it may be necessary to process personal data. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we generally obtain the consent of the person concerned.
</p><p>The processing of personal data, for example the name, address, e-mail address or telephone number of a data subject, is always carried out in accordance with the Basic Data Protection Regulation and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to Nexttuna. By means of this data protection declaration, our company wishes to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. In addition, this Privacy Policy will inform individuals about their rights.
</p><p>As the data controller, Nexttuna has implemented numerous technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data processed via this website is protected as completely as possible. Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions can in principle have security gaps, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every person concerned is free to transmit personal data to us by alternative means, such as telephone.
</p><p><strong>1. Definitions of terms
</strong></p><p>Nexttuna's data protection declaration is based on the terms used by the European Directive and Ordinance Giver in the adoption of the Basic Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO). Our data protection declaration should be easy to read and understand both for the public and for our customers and business partners. In order to guarantee this, we would like to explain the terms used in advance.
</p><p>We use the following terms in this data protection declaration:
</p><p>a) Personal data
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"). A natural person shall be considered identifiable if he can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more specific characteristics expressing the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.&nbsp;</span></p><p>(b) Data subject
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Data subject means any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data are processed by the controller.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(c) Processing
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is carried out with or without the aid of automated processes and which relates to personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation, sorting, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or association, qualification, erasure or destruction.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">(d) Limitation of processing&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Limitation of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their future processing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>e) Profiling
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Profiling is any automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the work performance, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, conduct, whereabouts or movement of that natural person.&nbsp;</span></p><p>(f) Pseudonymisation
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the provision of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures ensuring that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(g) Controller or controller
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The controller or data controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are laid down by Union law or by the law of the Member States, the controller or controllers may be designated in accordance with Union law or with the law of the Member States on the basis of specific criteria.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(h) Processor
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.&nbsp;</span></p><p>(i) Recipient
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to whom personal data are disclosed, whether or not that person is a third party. However, authorities which may receive personal data in the course of a specific investigation task under Union law or the law of the Member States shall not be considered as recipients.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(j) Third parties
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Third party means any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons authorised to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or processor.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(k) Consent 
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Consent shall mean any voluntary, informed and unambiguous expression by the data subject of his or her will in the particular case, in the form of a statement or other unequivocal confirmatory act, indicating that he or she consents to the processing of his or her personal data.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>2. The name and address of the person responsible for the processing
</strong></p><p>Responsible person in the sense of the data protection basic regulation, other data protection laws valid in the member states of the European Union and other regulations with data protection-juridical character is responsible:
</p><p>Next Tuna GmbH
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Geschäftsführer: Eckhardt, Andrew Hans Richard&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Londoner Str. 3&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">60327 Frankfurt am Main&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Germany&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>3. Cookies
</strong></p><p>The Nexttuna website uses cookies. Cookies are text files which are stored on a computer system via an Internet browser.
</p><p>Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the person concerned from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A particular Internet browser can be recognized and identified by its unique cookie ID.
</p><p>By using cookies, Nexttuna can provide users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the setting of cookies.
</p><p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimised in the interests of the user. As already mentioned, cookies enable us to recognise the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses cookies does not have to re-enter his access data each time he visits the website because this is taken over by the website and the cookie stored on the user's computer system.
</p><p>The person concerned can at any time prevent the cookies from being set by our website by means of an appropriate setting in the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the person concerned deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it is possible that not all wireless services are available.
</p><p><strong>4. Collection of general data and information
</strong></p><p>The Nexttuna website collects a series of general data and information each time the website is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information is stored in the log files of the server. The types and versions of browsers used may be recorded: (1) the operating system used by the accessing system, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-sites accessed via an accessing system on our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information used to avert dangers in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
</p><p>Nexttuna does not draw any conclusions about the person concerned when using this general data and information. This information is required (1) to correctly deliver the content of our website, (2) to optimise the content of our website and the advertising for it, (3) to ensure the long-term operability of our information technology systems and the technology of our website and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber attack. This anonymously collected data and information is therefore evaluated by Nexttuna both statistically and with the aim of increasing data protection and data security in our company in order to ultimately ensure an optimum level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by the person concerned.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>5. Registration on our website</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The data subject shall have the possibility to register on the website of the controller by providing personal data. The personal data transmitted to the data controller in this process is determined by the respective input mask used for registration. The personal data entered by the data subject shall be collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and for its own purposes. The controller may arrange for the data to be disclosed to one or more processors, such as a parcel service, who will also use the personal data solely for internal purposes attributable to the controller.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>By registering on the controller's website, the IP address assigned to the data subject by the Internet service provider (ISP), the date and time of registration are also stored. This data is stored in order to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, to enable us to investigate criminal offences. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary to safeguard the data controller. These data will not be passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to do so or the data is used for criminal prosecution.
</p><p>The registration of the data subject with voluntary disclosure of personal data serves the purpose of the data controller to offer the data subject content or services which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered users. Registered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during registration at any time or to have them completely deleted from the database of the data controller.
</p><p>The data controller shall provide any data subject with information on the personal data stored on the data subject at any time upon request. Furthermore, the data controller shall correct or delete personal data at the request or notice of the data subject, unless this is contrary to any legal obligation to retain such data. The entire staff of the data controller shall be available to the data subject as contact persons in this context.
</p><p><strong>6. Possibility of contact via the website
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>The Nexttuna website contains, in accordance with statutory provisions, information that enables us to be contacted quickly and electronically and to communicate directly with us, which also includes a general address for so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the data controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject is automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted voluntarily by a data subject to the data controller will be stored for the purposes of processing or contacting the data subject. This personal data will not be passed on to third parties.
</p><p><strong>7. Routine deletion and blocking of personal data
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>The controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period of time necessary to achieve the storage purpose or where provided for by the European directive and regulation maker or another legislator in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject.
</p><p>If the storage purpose no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by the European directive and regulation giver or another competent legislator expires, the personal data shall be blocked or deleted routinely and in accordance with the statutory provisions.
</p><p><strong>8. Rights of the data subject
</strong></p><p>a) Right to confirmation
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Every data subject shall have the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether personal data relating to him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of confirmation, he or she may at any time contact an employee of the controller.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>b) Right of access
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to obtain at any time, free of charge, from the controller, information on the personal data relating to him which have been stored and a copy of that information. Furthermore, the European Data Protection Supervisor has granted the data subject access to the following information:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>- the purposes of the processing
</p><p>- the categories of personal data processed
</p><p>- the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations
</p><p>- if possible, the planned duration for which the personal data will be stored or, if that is not possible, the criteria for determining that duration
</p><p>- the existence of a right to the rectification or erasure of personal data concerning him or her or to the limitation of the processing carried out by the controller or of a right to object to such processing
</p><p>- the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority
</p><p>- if the personal data are not collected from the data subject: All available information on the origin of the data
</p><p>- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Article 22(1) and (4) of the DS Block Exemption Regulation and, at least in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved, the scope and the intended effects of such processing on the data subject
</p><p>The data subject also has the right to know whether personal data have been transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. If this is the case, the data subject shall also have the right to obtain information on the appropriate safeguards in connection with the transfer.
</p><p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may at any time contact a member of staff of the controller.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>(c) Right to rectification
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to request the rectification without delay of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Furthermore, the data subject shall have the right, having regard to the purposes of the processing, to request the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of rectification, he or she may at any time contact a member of staff of the controller.&nbsp;</span></p><p>d) Right to deletion (right to be forgotten)
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person data subject to the processing of personal data shall have the right, granted by the European directive and regulation, to require the controller to erase without delay personal data concerning him which are subject to one of the following conditions and to the extent that the processing is not necessary:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>- Personal data have been collected or otherwise processed for purposes for which they are no longer necessary.
</p><p>- The data subject withdraws his consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DS-GVO or Art. 9 para. 2 letter a DS-GVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing.
</p><p>- The data subject objects to the processing under Article 21(1) DS Block Exemption Regulation and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for the processing or the data subject objects to the processing under Article 21(2) DS Block Exemption Regulation.
</p><p>- The personal data have been processed unlawfully.
</p><p>- The deletion of the personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States to which the controller is subject.
</p><p>- The personal data were collected in relation to information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1 DS-GVO.
</p><p>If one of the above reasons applies and a data subject wishes to have personal data stored at Nexttuna deleted, he or she can contact an employee of the data controller at any time. The Nexttuna employee shall arrange for the request for deletion to be complied with immediately.
</p><p>If Nexttuna has made the personal data public and our company is obliged to delete the personal data as the person responsible pursuant to Art. 17 Para. 1 DS-GVO, Nexttuna shall take appropriate measures, including technical measures, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs, to inform other persons responsible for data processing who process the published personal data that the data subject has requested these other persons responsible for data processing to delete all links to this personal data or copies or replications of this personal data, insofar as this processing is not necessary. The Nexttuna employee will take the necessary steps in individual cases.
</p><p>(e) Right to limitation of processing
<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person data subject to the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation, to request the controller to limit the processing if one of the following conditions is met:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>- The accuracy of the personal data shall be contested by the data subject for a period of time which allows the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.
</p><p>- The processing is unlawful and the data subject refuses to erase the personal data and instead requests that the use of the personal data be restricted.
</p><p>- The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the data subject needs them for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal rights.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p><p>- The data subject has lodged an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DS-GVO and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the data controller outweigh those of the data subject.
</p><p>If one of the above conditions is met and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored at Nexttuna, he or she can contact an employee of the data controller at any time. The Nexttuna employee will arrange for the processing to be restricted.
</p><p>f) Right to data transferability<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any data subject involved in the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation, to obtain personal data concerning him or her which have been provided by the data subject to a controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format. It also has the right to communicate these data to another controller without being hindered by the controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on the consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter a DS-GVO or Art. 9 para. 2 letter a DS-GVO or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 letter b DS-GVO and the processing is carried out by automated means, provided that the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority entrusted to the controller.</span></p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when exercising his right to data transferability pursuant to Art. 20 (1) DS Block Exemption Regulation, the data subject shall have the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly from one data controller to another data controller insofar as this is technically feasible and insofar as this does not impair the rights and freedoms of other persons.
</p><p>
</p><p>In order to assert the right to data transferability, the person concerned can contact a Nexttuna employee at any time.
</p><p>
</p><p>g) Right of objection<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person data subject to the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to object at any time, for reasons related to his/her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him/her on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the DS Block Exemption Regulation. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</span></p><p>
</p><p>Nexttuna will no longer process personal data in the event of objection, unless we can prove compelling grounds for processing worthy of protection which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
</p><p>
</p><p>If Nexttuna processes personal data in order to conduct direct advertising, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of such advertising. This also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If the data subject objects to Nexttuna's processing for direct marketing purposes, Nexttuna will no longer process the personal data for these purposes
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, the data subject has the right to object to the processing of personal data relating to him/her by Nexttuna for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89 (1) DS-GVO for reasons arising from his particular situation, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest.
</p><p>
</p><p>In order to exercise the right to object, the person concerned may directly contact any Nexttuna employee or another employee. The data subject is also free to exercise his or her right of objection in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.
</p><p>
</p><p>(h) Automated case-by-case decisions, including profiling<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person data subject to the processing of personal data has the right under the European Directive and Regulation not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects upon him or her or significantly affects him or her in a similar manner, provided that the decision (1) is not necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller, or (2) is authorised by Union or national law or by the Member States to which the data controller is subject and which provides for adequate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the data subject, or (3) is taken with the express consent of the data subject. Where the decision (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller or (2) is taken with the express consent of the data subject, Nexttuna shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the data subject, including at least the right to have the data controller intervene, to present his or her point of view and to contest the decision.</span></p><p>
</p><p>If the data subject wishes to exercise rights relating to automated decisions, he may at any time do so by contacting an employee of the controller.
</p><p>
</p><p>i) Right to revoke consent under data protection law<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulation maker, to revoke consent to the processing of personal data at any time.</span></p><p>
</p><p>If the data subject wishes to exercise his or her right to withdraw consent, he or she may at any time do so by contacting an employee of the controller.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>9. Data protection for applications and in the application procedure
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The data controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of processing the application procedure. Processing may also be carried out electronically. This is particularly the case if an applicant submits the relevant application documents electronically, for example by e-mail or via a web form on the website, to the data controller. If the data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the data transmitted shall be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the controller does not conclude a contract of employment with the applicant, the application documents shall be automatically deleted two months after notification of the rejection decision, unless deletion conflicts with any other legitimate interests of the controller. Other legitimate interests in this sense include, for example, the duty to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz - AGG).
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>10. Data protection regulations on the use and application of Fotalia and istockfoto images
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The data controller has integrated components of Fotalia and istockfoto on this website. Fotalia and istockfoto is an American photo agency. A picture agency is a company that offers pictures and other picture material on the market. Picture agencies usually market photographs, illustrations and film material. A picture agency licenses the pictures used by various customers, in particular website operators, editorial offices of print and TV media and advertising agencies, through a picture agency. Fotalia and istockfoto allow the embedding of stick pictures. Embedding is the integration of a certain foreign content, for example text, video or image data, which is provided by a foreign website and then appears on the own website. A so-called embedding code is used for embedding. An embedding code is an HTML code that is integrated into a website by a website operator. If an embed code has been integrated by a website operator, the external content of the other website is displayed by default as soon as a website is visited. To display the external content, the external content is loaded directly from the other website.
</p><p>
</p><p>Through the technical implementation of the embed code, which enables the display of images from Fotalia and istockfoto, the IP address of the Internet connection through which the person concerned accesses our website is transmitted to Fotalia and istockfoto. Fotalia and istockfoto also collect information about our website, the type of browser used, browser language, time and length of access. In addition, Fotalia and istockfoto may collect navigational information, which is information about which of our sub-pages the individual visited and which links the individual clicked, and other interactions the individual performed when visiting our website. This information may be stored and evaluated by Fotalia and istockfoto.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>11. Privacy policy regarding the use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The data controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymisation function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, collection and evaluation of data on the behaviour of visitors to Internet pages. A web analysis service collects data on, among other things, from which website a person concerned came to a website (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is mainly used to optimise a website and to analyse the costs and benefits of Internet advertising. The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
</p><p>
</p><p>The data controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for the web analysis via Google Analytics. This addition is used by Google to shorten and anonymise the IP address of the Internet connection of the person concerned if access to our Internet pages is from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

</p><p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyse the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us showing the activities on our website and to provide other services in connection with the use of our website.
</p><p>
</p><p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. What cookies are has already been explained above. When the cookie is set, Google is able to analyse the use of our website. Each time you access one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the data controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently to enable commission statements.
</p><p>
</p><p>The cookie is used to store personal information such as the access time, the location from which the access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the person concerned. Each time you visit our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the Internet connection used by the person concerned, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may share this personal data collected through the technical process with third parties.
</p><p>
</p><p>The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
</p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, it is possible for the person concerned to object to and prevent the collection of data generated by Google Analytics and relating to the use of this website and the processing of this data by Google. For this purpose, the person concerned must download and install a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout . This browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information on visits to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered a contradiction by Google. If the data subject's information technology system is later deleted, formatted or reinstalled, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned or by another person within his/her sphere of control, the browser add-on may be reinstalled or reactivated.

</p><p><strong>12. Legal basis of the processing
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Art. 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as a legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of other services or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same shall apply to such processing operations which are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries regarding our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation which requires the processing of personal data, such as for the fulfilment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may become necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor to our site were injured and his name, age, health insurance information or other vital information would have to be disclosed to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO. Ultimately, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not predominate. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the data controller (recital 47 sentence 2 DS-GVO).
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>13. Legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party 
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is the conduct of our business for the benefit of all our employees and shareholders.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>14. Duration for which the personal data are stored
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective legal retention period. After this period has expired, the corresponding data will be routinely deleted unless they are no longer required for the fulfilment or initiation of the contract.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>15. Legal or contractual provisions relating to the provision of personal data; the need to conclude a contract; the obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; the possible consequences of not providing the personal data
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>We will inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or may result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary for a contract to be concluded that a person concerned makes personal data available to us which must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide personal data would mean that the contract could not be concluded with the data subject. The data subject must contact one of our employees before providing personal data. Our employee will inform the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of a contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of not providing the personal data.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>16. Existence of automated decision making
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>As a responsible company, we refrain from automatic decision-making or profiling.</p><p>
